Repo for Coursera courses

I intially tried myBinder, but with that I couldn't directly commit to github. Had to download changes than upload them.

Already had previously used Google collab for notebooks on GitHub, but at that time I wasn't aware that I can also clone repos to GDrive. So this is my try on using GDrive-Collab-Github
